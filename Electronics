Following Electronics are needed for this project:

- Arduino Nano Every
  10 USD
  It has a larger flash memory and more digital Outputs compared to the typical Arduino boards, which are required for the sketch.
  The Every can accept up to 21 V Input, So no external step down converter is required, if using a 12V Power Supply

- 3 x A4988 Stepper Motor Drivers
  5 USD
  Of course every other Stepper Motor Driver will work
  
- 1.5 inch OLED
  15 USD
  Use one with HW SPI. SW SPI and I2C are slow on the every.

- Rotary Encoder with Push Button
  5 USD
  
- 12V Fan
  5 USD
  
- Some small Parts like capacitors, a switch, a 10k resistor and a perfboard
  5 USD
